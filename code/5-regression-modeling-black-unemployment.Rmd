```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load libraries
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)   # for printing tables
library(cowplot)      # for side by side plots
library(glmnetUtils)  # for running ridge and lasso
library(ISLR2)        # necessary for College data 
library(pROC)         # for ROC curves
library(tidyverse)  
library(dplyr)
```

# Read in the test and training data

```{r}
# load the data
unemploy_train = read_tsv(file = "~/Desktop/STAT471/unemployment-project/data/clean/econ_train.tsv")
unemploy_test = read_tsv(file = "~/Desktop/STAT471/unemployment-project/data/clean/econ_test.tsv")
variable_names = read_tsv(file = "~/Desktop/STAT471/unemployment-project/data/clean/var_names.tsv")

# install.packages("scales")              # dependency of plot_glmnet
source("~/Desktop/STAT471/unemployment-project/code/functions/plot_glmnet.R")
```

Now we will build some predictive models for `black_unemployment`. I will remove the `date`, `unemployment_rate`, and `percent_dif_unemploy` variables from the training and test sets since it is not a feature we will be using for prediction:
```{r}
unemploy_train = unemploy_train %>% select(-c(date, unemployment_rate, percent_dif_unemploy))
unemploy_test = unemploy_test %>% select(-c(date, unemployment_rate, percent_dif_unemploy))
```

# Run least-squares/ linear regression

```{r lm-fit, echo=FALSE}
#run linear regression
lm_fit_black = lm(black_unemployment ~ ., data = unemploy_train)
r_squared_lm = summary(lm_fit_black)$r.squared
# save the linear regression fit object
save(lm_fit_black , file = "~/Desktop/STAT471/unemployment-project/results/lm_fit_black.Rda")
```

# Run ridge regression

```{r ridge-fit, echo=FALSE}
#run ridge fit
set.seed(3) # set seed before cross-validation for reproducibility
ridge_fit_black = cv.glmnet(black_unemployment ~ ., alpha = 0, nfolds = 10, data = unemploy_train) 
plot(ridge_fit_black)

#lambda use 1se rule 
lambda = ridge_fit_black$lambda.1se
sprintf("The value of lambda based on the one-standard-error rule: %f",
        lambda)

#Visualize the ridge regression fitted coefficients, highlighting 6 features using the `features_to_plot` argument
#Consider: do any features changes signs as lambda increases
plot_glmnet(ridge_fit_black, unemploy_train, features_to_plot = 6)

save(ridge_fit_black, file = "~/Desktop/STAT471/unemployment-project/results/ridge_fit_black.Rda")
```

# Run lasso regression

```{r lasso-fit}
#run lasso fit
set.seed(5) # set seed before cross-validation for reproducibility
lasso_fit_black = cv.glmnet(black_unemployment ~ ., alpha = 1, nfolds = 10, data = unemploy_train) 
plot(lasso_fit_black)

lambda_lasso_black = lasso_fit_black$lambda.1se
sprintf("The value of lambda based on the one-standard-error rule: %f",
        lambda_lasso_black)

#How many features are selected if features are chosen according to the 1 se rule?
num_features_black = lasso_fit_black$nzero[lasso_fit_black$lambda == lasso_fit_black$lambda.1se]

#Need to add more colors 
#Use `plot_glmnet` to visualize the lasso fitted coefficients, which by default will highlight the features selected by the lasso
plot_glmnet(lasso_fit_black, unemploy_train, features_to_plot = 8)

save(lambda_lasso_black, file = "~/Desktop/STAT471/unemployment-project/results/lambda_lasso_black.Rda")
```

# Collect Coefficents into a Tibble 
```{r coefs}
#need to add lasso coefs 
lm_coefs_top10 = rownames(data.frame(coef(lm_fit_black)[-1]) %>%
